# Java Trail: Loops

This series of articles covers all types of loops in the Java language.

1.  [while loop](while-loop.html)
    A while loop runs statements repeatedly until a condition becomes false.

2.  [for loop](for-loop.html)
    Examples of for loops in Java. Both traditional for loops and for each loops ("enhanced for loops") are explained in detail.

3.  [for each loop](for-each-loop.html)
    For each loops are written as 'for (Type x : iterable) { ... }' and can be used to iterate over arrays or collections.

4.  [do…while loop](do-while-loop.html)
    A do…while loop runs statements once, checks the loop condition and continues to run the statemnets repeatedly until the condition becomes false.

5.  [Java Loops: break](break-loop.html)
    Examples of how to the break statement can be used to terminate a loop from within the loop body, before the loop condition becomes false.

6.  [Java Loops: continue](continue.html)
    Examples and illustrations of how to the continue statement can be used to control loop iteration.

7.  [Beware of accidental semicolons in while and for loops!](beware-of-accidental-semicolons-in-while-and-for-loops.html)
    An extra semicolon after while(...) or for(...) is interpreted as the body of the loop. The semicolon itself is a no-op statement and therefor often causes the program malfunction or crash.
