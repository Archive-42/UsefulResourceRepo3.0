Sliding Window Algorithm with Example
=====================================

A sliding window is a sublist that runs over an underlying collection. I.e., if you have an array like

    [a b c d e f g h]

a sliding window of size 3 would run over it like

    [a b c]
      [b c d]
        [c d e]
          [d e f]
            [e f g]
              [f g h]

This is useful if you for instance want to create a set of all adjacent pairs, or generate N-grams etc.
