# Go: Get started

_"Go is an open source pro­gram­ming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software."_  
[– golang.org](https://golang.org/)

## Try it out

[The Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/p/KZ6G2RCQuKj) is an interactive web service that lets you run small Go programs, such as this "Hello, world!" program, inside a sandbox. Try it out!

    package main

    import (
            "fmt"
    )

    func main() {
            fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
    }

## Learn the basics

[A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) is an interactive tutorial with many example programs.

- It teaches you the basics of Go programming directly in your browser.
- Also, it's fun.

## Install the tools

[Getting Started](https://golang.org/doc/install) explains how to install the Go tools.

- It has binary distributions for many platforms, inlucding **FreeBSD**, **Linux**, **Mac OS X**, **Windows** and **x86** processor architectures.
- It also explains how to install from source.

## Start a project

[How to Write Go Code](https://golang.org/doc/code.html) demonstrates the development of a simple Go package.

- It shows how to organize and test your code.
- It also introduces the [`go`](https://golang.org/cmd/go/) command, the standard way to fetch, build, and install Go packages and commands.

[Writing, building, installing, and testing Go code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCsL89YtqCs) is a screencast covering the same topics.
