### Get tips for improving

Each test comes with helpful steps to improve your site's results.

How your site is measured
-------------------------

When you measure your site, web.dev uses [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/), an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. Lighthouse will audit your site in the following categories:

![](/images/icons/performance.svg)

Performance

Audits for metrics like first paint and time to interactive to determine lag.

![](/images/icons/best_practices.svg)

Best Practices

Looks for everything from HTTPS usage to correct image aspect ratios.

![](/images/icons/seo.svg)

SEO

Checks for best practices to ensure your site is discoverable.

![](/images/icons/a11y.svg)

Accessibility

Checks for common issues that may prevent users from accessing your content.

All tests are run using a simulated mobile device, throttled to a fast 3G network & 4x CPU slowdown.
